Question:
A robot moves UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Compute final distance from origin (rounded).

Code:

# Q10: Robot Movement
import math
x = y = 0
while True:
    try:
        s = input()
        if not s: break
        direction, steps = s.split()
        steps = int(steps)
        if direction == "UP": y += steps
        elif direction == "DOWN": y -= steps
        elif direction == "LEFT": x -= steps
        elif direction == "RIGHT": x += steps
    except: break
dist = round(math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2))
print(dist)


Input:

UP 5
DOWN 3
LEFT 3
RIGHT 2


Output:

2
