Question:
Find all numbers between 1000 and 3000 (inclusive) such that each digit of the number is even.

Code:

result = []
for num in range(1000, 3001):
    if all(int(d) % 2 == 0 for d in str(num)):
        result.append(str(num))
print(",".join(result))


Output (first few numbers):

2000,2002,2004,2006,2008,2020,2022,...,2888
